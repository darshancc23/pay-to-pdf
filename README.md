# Pay-to-pdf

#GOAL : Build an application that generates payment details in PDF format after every successfull payment.

#ABOUT : Currently the application is taking in inputs like name and email id only. After entering above details,users are directed to a payment window where they can choose                from a variety of payment options like netbanking, wallets, cards etc.
                                                                                  After successful completion of payment,the application builds a pdf having the associated name and email.
                                                                                  
#NEED : Inviting the open source community to work on additional functionalities. 
        Also look into the issues listed. 

Happy Coding :)

Thank you.
