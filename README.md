# pay-to-pdf

One Paragraph of project description goes here

Goal : Build an application that generates payment details in PDF format after every successfull payment.
Currently the application is taking in inputs like name and email id only. Following which the user is directed to a payment window where they can chose from a variety of payment options like netbanking, wallets, cards etc.
On payment completion, the application builds a pdf having the entered name and email(as entered).
Inviting the open source community to work on additional functionalities. Also look into the issues listed.
